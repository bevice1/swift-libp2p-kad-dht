## Overview
The Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT) subsystem in libp2p is a DHT implementation largely based on the Kademlia [0] whitepaper, augmented with notions from S/Kademlia [1], Coral [2] and the BitTorrent DHT.

#### DHT operations

The libp2p Kademlia DHT offers the following types of operations:

- **Peer routing**

  - Finding the closest nodes to a given key via `FIND_NODE`.

- **Value storage and retrieval**

  - Storing a value on the nodes closest to the value's key by looking up the
    closest nodes via `FIND_NODE` and then putting the value to those nodes via
    `PUT_VALUE`.

  - Getting a value by its key from the nodes closest to that key via
    `GET_VALUE`.

- **Content provider advertisement and discovery**

  - Adding oneself to the list of providers for a given key at the nodes closest
    to that key by finding the closest nodes via `FIND_NODE` and then adding
    oneself via `ADD_PROVIDER`.

  - Getting providers for a given key from the nodes closest to that key via
    `GET_PROVIDERS`.

In addition the libp2p Kademlia DHT offers the auxiliary _bootstrap_ operation.

#### Note:
- For more information check out the [Kad DHT Spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/kad-dht/README.md)

## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
```Swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(name: "LibP2PKadDHT", url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-kad-dht.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
    
    ...
)
```

## Usage

### Example 
check out the [tests]() for more examples

```Swift

import LibP2PKadDHT

let app = Application(.detect())

/// If you'd like to use the DHT as a DHT...
app.dht.use( .kadDHT )

/// Or if you're just interested in its peer discovery functionality
app.discovery.use(.kadDHT)

```

### API
```Swift
